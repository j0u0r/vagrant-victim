# Errors I faced while developing this program
**Error 1: Stuck at "Enabling and Configuring Shared Folders"**
> - On the machine itself, press VM at the top left of the window, press install/reinstall VMware tools
> - If unable to do so, check error 2

**Error 2: "Install/reinstall VMware tools" is greyed out**
> - Go to VM, Settings, press Add...,  select CD/DVD Drive, press Finish, check the option again,it should not be greyed out anymore
